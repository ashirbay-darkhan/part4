# Server Code Optimizations

This document describes the server code optimizations made to improve performance, reduce unnecessary files/code, and enhance maintainability.

## Removed Unnecessary Files

1. **Development Utility Scripts**
   - `fix-business-id.js` - One-time utility script for fixing business IDs
   - `debug-services.js` - Development-only debugging tool
   - `reset-db.js` - Database reset utility for development

2. **Duplicate API Files**
   - `lib/dummy-data.ts` - Redundant test data (replaced by in-memory fallback data)
   - `lib/api/staff-service.ts` - Duplicate API functionality (consolidated into main API)

## Code Optimizations in `json-server.js`

1. **Reduced Logging Overhead**
   - Limited detailed request body logging to development mode only
   - Eliminated verbose response logging (replaced with concise summaries)
   - Removed redundant console log messages

2. **Removed Redundant Code**
   - Eliminated unnecessary watchOptions configuration
   - Removed redundant custom router implementation
   - Consolidated duplicate GET/PATCH route handlers
   - Simplified entity creation routes

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - More consistent error responses
   - Removed redundant error checking

## Performance Improvements

1. **Faster Response Times**
   - Reduced overhead from excessive logging
   - More efficient route handling
   - Streamlined middleware operations

2. **Better Resource Utilization**
   - Eliminated unnecessary file operations
   - Reduced memory usage from redundant code
   - Improved server startup time

## Benefits

- **Cleaner Codebase**: Fewer files and less code to maintain
- **Faster Performance**: Reduced processing overhead
- **Better Maintainability**: Less duplication and clearer structure
- **More Reliable**: Fewer potential points of failure

## Potential Future Optimizations

1. Implement proper authentication with JWT
2. Add password hashing for security
3. Organize routes into modular files
4. Add database connection pooling for further optimization
5. Implement proper error logging system
