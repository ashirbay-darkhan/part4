Fix for app/(dashboard)/analytics/page.tsx syntax error:

The error occurs at line 491 with the message: "Expected ',', got '}'".

Looking at the error context:
Line 488:     </div>
Line 489:   );
Line 490: }
Line 491:   }, [selectedDateRange, customDateStart, customDateEnd]);
Line 492: 
Line 493:   // Filter appointments based on date range and search query
Line 494:   const filteredAppointments = useMemo(() => {

The issue is that there's a stray closing brace '}' followed by a dependency array on line 491 that appears after the component's main function has already been closed.

Fix:
1. Simply remove line 491:   }, [selectedDateRange, customDateStart, customDateEnd]);
2. This appears to be a fragment of a useCallback or useMemo hook that was incorrectly placed outside of the component.
3. The getDateRange function already has its proper dependency array defined earlier in the file.

After fixing, the code should look like:
Line 488:     </div>
Line 489:   );
Line 490: }
Line 491: 
Line 492:   // Filter appointments based on date range and search query
Line 493:   const filteredAppointments = useMemo(() => {
